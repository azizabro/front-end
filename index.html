<h1 style="background-color:red">Global Warming</h1>
<p>
<strong>97%</strong> of climate scientists agree that the planet is heating up. Meaning that the greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, most common of which is carbon dioxide, are trappind the sun's heat in the planet's atmosphere and hence heating up the environment as a whole. This process is injurious to the planet's overall health, especially the biosphere that supports all life on earth. This problem is a result of some natural events such as volcanic eruptions, but is mostly caused by man made products and activities such as fuel burning and various industrial processes. This mostly man made phenomenon is destroying the planet. The consequences of climate change are rising sea levels, more frequent and more dangerous climate disasters, and food insecurity for all life on earth. This is a global problem man made problem, and a truly global effort by all of humanity will be needed to arrest the most severe of its consequences.

<h2>What is Global Warming?</h2>
<p>
The <i>sun</i> is a very hot body. Due its very high surface temprature, its emissions are often in the high-frequency range. This means its rays are more powerful and can penetrate through earth's atmosphere with ease. But when these rays strike the surface, some of their energy is lost and are reflected back as low-frequency, low enery infrared rays. These rays cannot easily escape the greenhouse gases of our atmosphere and get trapped, eventually increasing the energy/temprature of the atmosphere itself. The amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will directly affect how much of this energy/heat is trapped into the atmosphere, and resultantly how much will the climate be heated by this.

<h2>Factors contributing to the menace of Global Warming</h2>

<p>
<strong>Greenhouse gases</strong> are the biggest contributers to <i>global warming</i>. To understand the factors contributing to global warming, it is imperative to know and understand the multiple factors contributing to the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
</p>
<p><strong>29%</strong> of all greenhouse emissions in the U.S. are caused by automobiles. They are the single largest contributors to global warming throughout the world. Cars that are run on petrol/diesel are constantly burning hydrocarbons to run their engines and produce carbon dioxide as a biproduct. Encouraging public transports and shifting towards electric vehicles in the way to deal with this problem.
</p>
<p>
After the transportation industry, <strong>industrial manufacturing</strong> takes up the second place as the largest greenhouse contributor in our environment. And unlike automobiles, we have no greenhouse efficient alternatives to this problem. There are no emission-free ways to manufacture cement for example. Dealing with this side of the problem required heavy investments in research and development to develop new and environment friendly ways to manufacture these products. A carbon-tax on industrial emissions could also be used as a short-term solution. As Elon Musk said,
</p>
<p><blockquote>
"My top recommendation for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a carbon tax."
</blockquote></p>
<p>
<strong>Deforestation</strong> is an activity that is also directly contributing to the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Trees have this special ability to absorb carbon dioxide (the most abundant greenhouse gas) and convert it to oxygen for other animals to breathe. This means that when more and more trees are cut for agricultural or construction purposes, less and less carbon dioxide is being absorbed from the atmosphere, eventually contributing to the problem of global warming. The only way to tackle this issue is to stop cutting trees and planting new ones.
</p>

<h2>Consequences of Global Warming</h2>
<p>
Global Warming simply means that the atmosphere overall is warming up over time. And one of the simplest effects of warming is the melting of ice. As the atmosphere gets warmer, Antarctican glaciers and the arctic ocean will slowly start to melt. This melting of polar ice will quickly raise sea levels and cause devastating damage to coastal areas. Hundreds of millions of people around the world live in areas that are likely to be underwater by the next several decades. Maldives is a prime example, its total land mass is suspected to be under the Indian ocean by 2070. This is an alarming situation.
</p>
<p>
Another consequence of global warming is dangerous climate disasters. With the atmosphere trying to adjust to the constantly changing temprature levels, unpredictable weather events such as hurricanes, storms, and floods are occuring in different parts of the world. Such natural disasters can cause unthinkable damage to life and property.
</p>
<p>
These changing weather patters mean that our food sources aren't adapted to the changed temprature and weather patterns. This will have a direct (and negative) impact on our agricultural production. Such impacts would cause unprecedented food problems for earth's evergrowing population and may cause millions to starve. 
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
To sum it all up, global warming is the increasing in average global tempratures over time due to the increasing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases are caused by,
<ul style="text-align:left">
<li>Automobiles</li>
<li>Industrial Manufacturing</li>
<li>Deforestation</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
And the consequences of Global Warming can be summed up as,
<ul style="text-align:left">
<li>Melting polar-ice caps and rising sea levels</li>
<li>Dangerous climate events</li>
<li>Food insecurity</li>
</ul>
